What's uPorts

- Plan to have a simple package manager to help software development
- Use this simple package manager to manage 3rdparty OSS packages
  which was needed during software development
- These 3rdparty OSS packages may include libraries, toolchain and utilities ...
- Target to clone this simple package manager from FreeBSD Ports system
- We call this simple package manager as "uPorts" (mirco Ports) because
  it will be kept as simple as possible



Branches History

I. infra

- first implementation of six Ports main targets:

  (fetch)
  extract patch configure build install package

II. infra2

- Align main targets to recent FreeBSD Ports system, including:

  1. add new STAGE related targets
  2. add new simple package utility
  3. re-implement PACKAGE and INSTALL related targets

- Suggest test sequence

  make stage; make check-plist; make stage-qa; make package
  env DESTDIR=~/local make install-package
  env DESTDIR=~/local make install
  env DESTDIR=~/local make deinstall
  env DESTDIR=~/local make install
  make distclean
  make delete-package

- Note

  1. At this moment, package actually install by "install-package"
     target, not by "install" target.
  2. "install" target only check package already installed or not.

III. tools

Compare with "Flavors" are a way to have multiple variations of a port,
tools.mk try to add "Groups" support, which

- Allow group multiple uports package into many groups
- Each uports group able to set its own DESTDIR and PREFIX, etc...
- A wrapping make targets, which form like "group@uports.build", are
  provided for easy usage
